Definition:
The Roblox Metaverse is an "immersive" "3D" "virtual" "space" that allows "players" (users) to "experience" different "games", "interact" with other players and much more. The "platform" also provides developers with 3D development tools and resources, where "players can create their 3D objects and worlds" (content creation). The platform has also created its own "virtual economy", where creators can sell their creations using the platformâ€™s native "currency", i.e., Robux. In addition, players can jump into different virtual "worlds" (multiple worlds) to play games, shop and interact with other "avatars".
