Definition:
Decentraland is a "decentralized" "virtual reality" (VR) "platform" powered by the Ethereum "blockchain". Within the Decentraland platform, "users" can "create", "experience", and "monetize" (economy) their "content" and applications.
The finite, traversable, "3D" "virtual" "space" within Decentraland is called LAND, a "non-fungible" (NFT) "digital asset" maintained in an Ethereum smart contract. Land is divided into parcels that are identified by cartesian coordinates (x,y). These parcels are permanently "owned by members" (ownership) of the community and are purchased using MANA, Decentralandâ€™s "cryptocurrency" token. This gives users full "control" over the "environments" and applications that they create, which can range from anything like static 3D scenes to more "interactive" applications or "games".
