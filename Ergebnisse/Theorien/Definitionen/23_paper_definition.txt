Definition:
Metaverse (MS) is a "digital" "universe" "accessible" through a "virtual environment". It is established through the "merging of virtually improved physical and digital reality" (physical-virtuality). Metaverse (MS) offers "enhanced immersive experiences" and a more "interactive" learning experience for students in learning and educational settings. It is an expanded and "synchronous communication" setting that allows different "users" to share their experiences.
Metaverse system (MS) is a "digital" "space". It can be described as an "interoperable" and massively ("vast") scaled "network" of "real-time" rendered "3D" virtual "worlds" that can be "synchronously" accessed by an "unlimited number of people" with a personal sense of "presence". "Virtual Reality" (VR) has all the characteristics of completely synthetic sights. "VR headsets" include common methods of user interaction, such as head tracking or tangible controllers.
Users in the MS will develop content in the "digital twins". "Users can generate content" in commercial virtual environments.
A method to interact (via gestures, text, voice, and other means) ("multimodal"), and a manner of sharing information and modify objects is a prerequisite of a virtual world. How users perceive "virtual objects" and "multiuser communication" in virtual shared space will be crucial elements. Users in a virtual "shared" space like MS must "collaborate" synchronously with any changes or interactions from the physical equivalent, like "augmented reality" (AR), "mixed reality" (MR).
The basis of creating the MS is to blend the contemporaneous behaviors of all the objects, "avatars" symbolizing their users, and their interactions. "Personalised experiences" and interactions are the main features that make Metaverse effective.
