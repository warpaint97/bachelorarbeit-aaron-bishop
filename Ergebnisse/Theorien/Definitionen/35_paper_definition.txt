Definition:
Metaverse, a new "social imaginary".
Metaverse is an extension of the "internet" that may be developed through advances in a number of digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality, as well as new technical infrastructure and standards. The metaverse has been framed as a vision for the near future, a new understanding of our "virtual environment" and a natural extension of our social technology.
Metaverse-relevant emerging technologies, such as "virtual-reality headsets", "augmented reality" sensors, "blockchain", and so on.
The "social space" of the metaverse promises fidelity and "sociality" of the digital "experiences". The metaverse is positioned as an inevitable, industry-wide development characterized by "presence" and "closeness" and designed in a "person-centered" way that will enable a new "economy".
"Natural interactions" such as gesture and eventually thought, and "high-density displays" will afford vivid and lifelike views.
In the metaverse, people who are physically far away will be able to experience "co-presence" and "teleportation" will be possible. It shall be "interoperable" and therefore enforce industry-wide "standardization" and cooperation. "Creation", "customizable avatars" and "digital objects" will be central to how we express ourselves, and this is going to lead to entirely new experiences and economic opportunities using "digital goods".
A "billion people" should use the metaverse.
The emerging social imaginary of the metaverse suggests the development of a new "universe" for us to inhabit beyond our current one, carving out a new, "utopian" "space" within our existing universe.
