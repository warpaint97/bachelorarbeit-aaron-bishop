Minimal Metaverse:
The "metaverse(s)" refers to a concept of a "persistent" "digital" "world" that converges technologies like "AR" and "VR" with physical reality ("physical-virtuality") and succeeds the "internet" of today. It strives for "immersive" venues for "social interaction" over a distance. AR/VR allows for "verbal and non-verbal communcation" channels.

Social VR:
A novel venue for mediated social experiences is Social VR, an emerging ecology of commercial applications for avatar-based remote social interaction in shared virtual environments using VR technology (i.e., HMDs). Social VR offers embodied and immersive social experiences comparable to face-to-face interaction due to its verbal and non-verbal expression capabilities and the variety of social activity contexts it offers. It strives to achieve interpersonal relationships.
Sharing of personal physiological information, including facial features (e.g. through avatar creation or facial tracking), behavioral patterns, and voices. Biometric data can be used for effective use of the system.
