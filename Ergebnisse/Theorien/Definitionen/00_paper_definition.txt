Definition:
Metaverse is a set of "fully immersive" "easily accessible" "virtual/digital" "worlds" where "people" can "interact" with one another using "3D" "Avatars" in "real time". The Hardware for visualization and interaction are "Augmented and Virtual Reality Headsets". It will be "fully decentralized" which causes the issue of downloading only relevant environments as people are traversing the Metaverse. "Multimedia Networking", Storage and compression are important enablers. There is much attention from the Academic and Industry perspective. It allows "flexibility" and "control" through "creation of custom 3D-content" and environments using Procedural Content Generation (3D-PCG) for "high-quality multimedia content/experiences". "AI" can be used for PCG using different "input modalities". Since the Metaverse contains "extremely large volume of multimedia contents", a hybrid communication strategy based on both local storage and data streaming and "5G" networks are explored. Coding and compression using DNN for low-dimensional feature space for less disk storage can be useful. Metaverse integrates a collection of "multimedia contents". It manages creation, generation, transmission, and "vizualization of contents". Network communication, AI, "VR" hardware are needed for a comprehensive solution.
