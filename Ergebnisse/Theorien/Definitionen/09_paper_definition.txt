Definition:
Metaverse emphasizes "real-time" "interaction" and information "interconnection" and mainly relies on the "Internet of Things" to provide technical support. "Voice", Images ,"micro expression" and "body language" can be effectively perceived by metaverse.
Metaverse supports "large-scale users" to be "online" simultaneously. "AR", "VR", "brain computer interface" and other "interactive" technologies are used to improve "immersion" of the "virtual" "world". Metaverse achieves a high degree of "synchronization between the virtual world" (physical-virtuality) and the real society, and improves user participation by reducing the threshold of "content creation" with the help of advanced "cloud computing", "5G", "blockchain" and "AI" technologies. Everyone has a unique "identity" and value. "Human beings" can realize "real-time" interaction and enter the artificial virtual world by virtue of "VR devices", "mobile phones", computers. This ecosystem contains "user-centric" elements such as individual identity and a "virtual economy".
