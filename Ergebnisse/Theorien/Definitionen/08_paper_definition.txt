Definition:
Corporate-controlled metaverse platforms:
A Metaverse is a "persistent" and "immersive" "simulated world" that is "experienced" in the "first person" by large groups of simultaneous "users" who share a strong sense of "mutual presence" (public sphere). It can be a fully "virtual environment" (i.e., a Virtual Metaverse) or it can exist as layers of virtual content overlaid on the real world with convincing spatial registration (i.e., an Augmented Metaverse). "AR" and "VR" technologies are a part of the metaverse and focus on "interactivity" and allow for "real-time" "tracking" of the users.
The definition should allow for self-contained worlds rather than solely a single interoperable metaverse.
There will be "multiple metaverse platforms" that will track all kinds of data from "facial expressions", "speech", "emotional state", "body tracking" and more.
Agenda-driven "AI agents" in form of "avatars" will be able to approach users and interpret their data.
"Platform" providers controlling the metaverse will not just know how their users physically act and interact, but how they emotionally react as they traverse "real and virtual spaces" (physical-virtuality).
