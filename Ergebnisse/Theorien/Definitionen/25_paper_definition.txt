Definition:
The Metaverse will utilize "head-mounted devices" (HMDs) and "extended reality" (XR), including but not limited to "virtual and augmented reality" (VR/AR), as the medium to connect "avatars" and "users" in the real world. In addition, the Metaverse is supposed to provide "gamified experiences" around emerging "Web 3.0 technologies" and is anticipated to be the precursor of the so-called Multiverse, which will serve as an architecture of advanced XR experience realms. The Metaverse will utilize the following hardware and software components: "Hand- and non-handbased input devices", "scene/object/sound/speech recognition and synthesis", "motion rendering", and last but not least headmounted devices (HMDs).
One of the most recent books on the Metaverse, consolidated various perspectives to give the following central definition of the Metaverse: ‘‘The Metaverse represents the top-level hierarchy of "persistent" "virtual" "spaces" that may also interpolate in real life, so that "social, commercial, and personal experiences" emerge through Web 3.0 technologies.’’ In addition to incentivizing transactions, the Metaverse should provide gamified experiences, given that gamification will encompass the activity and story around emerging Web3.0 "non-fungible tokens" (NFTs). It will be a network of "interconnected" experiences and devices far beyond mere VR. The Metaverse will be about being inside the "Internet" rather than simply looking at it from a phone or computer screen. A "massively scaled" (vast) and "interoperable" "network" of "real-time" rendered "3D" virtual "worlds" that can be experienced "synchronously" and persistently by an effectively "unlimited number of users" with an individual sense of "presence", and with "continuity of data", such as "identity", history ("traceable data"), "entitlements", "objects", "communications", and payments ("economy").
