Metaverse has great business and education application potential, currently mostly games. It's a "shared" "virtual" "space" that provides information in "real time". People's "life" will become intertwined with the network as they are "transforming from real space to virtual space"(physical-virtuality) by shifting their lives, employment, property and information to virtual space. It'll enable learning across time, location, and space. Use in the broadcasting industry is explored. It allows to "break the barrier of external reality conditions".
