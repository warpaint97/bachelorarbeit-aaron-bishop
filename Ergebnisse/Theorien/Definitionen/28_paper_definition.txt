Definition:
The metaverse refers to a "collective virtual/digital environment" on the "Internet" that "incorporates both the physical and digital world" (physical-virtuality) as empowered by "extended reality" (XR) technology for "immersive" "real-time" "interaction" and "collaboration". Other "access" devices e.g. "mobile phones" and "display walls" are possible but standalone XR devices e.g. "VR headsets" (HMDs) enhance one's "experience" in the metaverse.
