Definition:
"Virtual Reality" (VR) "experience" "escapes" allow individuals to spend hours on end in immersive "virtual environments" and "interact" with "content" in a world that is providing "shelter" and illusion of an "alternative reality" â€“ the metaverse. It is an alternative world completely in the virtual "space". It is a virtual "ecosystem", which lets us enter a new chapter on VR consumer experiences.
Engaging in "fully immersive" virtual worlds where consumers can experience a heightened sense of "presence" can evoke feelings of euphoria and stimulate addiction to the content.
Negative psychological consequences of consumer-centered VR consumer experience escapes in the metaverse will affect "social interactions".
