Definition:
The core of the metaverse is a "virtual" "space" "based on the real world", extending from "pan-entertainment experience" such as games and "social interaction" to "offline and online integration" of various "realistic" scenes. Its core elements include "extreme immersion" "experience", "rich content ecology", "social" system beyond time and space ("no time constraint", "no space constraint"), and "economic system" of "virtual and real interaction". (physical-virtuality)
"Artificial intelligence" (AI) is still one of the important technologies to solve problems in metaverse.
