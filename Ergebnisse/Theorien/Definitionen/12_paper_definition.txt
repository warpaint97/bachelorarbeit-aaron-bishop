Highly intelligent Metaverse:
The Metaverse dipicts the "future Internet" age, consisting of a "continuously/persistently" "shared" "3D" "virtual space" connected to a perceptible virtual "universe", a "network" of "virtual environments" (interconnected) forever composed "online", in which one can manipulate their own virtual representations while "interacting" with "digital objects".
Technologies like "VR", "MR", "AR", "5G", "3D rendering", and "AI" form the infrastructure of the metaverse.
These technologies have enabled "NFT", "Avatars" and "cryptocurrencies" in order to achieve the 8 characteristics of the metaverse:
"Identity", "friends", "immersive", "low latency", "diversity", "anywhere", "economic system" and "civilisation".
The highly intelligent metaverse is based on "decentralization" and is carried by games.
