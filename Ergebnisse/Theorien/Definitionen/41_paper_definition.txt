Metaverse:
The metaverse is a "new Internet application" and "social" form that integrates a large number of new technologies, such as "Internet of Things" (IoT), "cloud computing", "blockchain", "artificial intelligence" (AI), "big data". It is also the "integration of digital world and physical world" (physical-virtuality), "digital economy and real economy", "digital life and real life", "digital identity and real identity", "digital assets and real assets". It provides "immersion" "experience" based on extended real-world technology, generates "mirror image of real-world" (parallel world) based on "digital twin" technology, builds economic system based on blockchain technology, realizes full integration of virtual and real world, and allows each user to “produce” content and “edit” the world ("content creation/editing"). Its essence is an aggregate of relevant technologies and is the "next generation internet". "VR" is an important technology of the metaverse and it can "break the space limitation of physical scenes", customize the "personalized viewing angle" for "users". VR allows for a "360-degree view". For the Metaverse-driven VR, VR technology can be relied on to create a VR world in the form of "three-dimensional" "interaction", so that traditional "culture" can "break through the limitations of time and space". VR "image rendering" requires strong "real-time" performance, so offloading VR computing tasks to the cloud, edge servers or mobile devices can reduce the average processing latency and enhance "user experience".
