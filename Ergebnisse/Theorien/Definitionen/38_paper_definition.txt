Definition:
The metaverse is "virtual" "world" that contains "avatars" of real-life people. It may become possible for people to "experience a whole range of emotions" in the metaverse. Supporting infrastructures, such as "5G", "virtual reality", "hologram technology" and advanced "graphic and data processors" would have to be developed and integrated simultaneously. The key charasteristics of metaverse are, a "span from physical to virtual worlds" (physical-virtuality), a fully fledged "economy", and unprecendented "interoperability". "Users" take their avatars and "goods" from one place int the metaverse to another, no matter who runs it. No one company will run the metaverse. It will be an "embodied" "internet" operated by many different players in a "decentralized" way.
It can be viewed as a "parallel universe" existing alongside the real world where "human beings" possess an avatar that resides in the metaverse, and virtual reality would be one of the many "access points".
Users interact through their avatars in the "limitless" metaverse.
In the metaverse "ecosystem", a way forward would be to view it as a "virtual community" existing in parallel to our real-world community. In the metaverse, "identity" is important. Preventing identity theft can be a problem in "metaverse platforms". The metaverse would "remove all barriers to freedom of interaction" and it would store "personal data".

VR platforms:
It seems that virtual reality platforms will be invasive as companies will be able to monitor facial expressions, physiological responses and biometric data.
